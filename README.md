<h1> Project Risk Management API </h1>

<h3>A Django-powered API which can be used for the purpose of resording and tracking Project risks</h3>

<p> Inspired by a real-world application, this is obviously not a valid production-worthy app but rather an exercise</br> in developing a REST API using the Django framework and it\'s included REST API library</p>
